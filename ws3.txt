I donft know what year this took place or how old Alex and Elysia are. Ifm going to assume this was the 1800s, possibly 1700s. Elysiafs parents and brother died two years before and shefs been living with her abusive and mentally ill aunt since. Her aunt is her motherfs step-sister and shefs extremely jealous of her, has been since they were little. After being locked into her bedroom, Elysia canft take it anymore and runs away by jumping out the window. She ends up at an inn called Wayfarefs Rest and thatfs where she meets Alex. We never hear from Aunt Agatha again.<br /><br />Therefs a villain, Jason Bellingham, whofs out to get Alex. He hates him for not allowing him to marry his ward, Catherine, but Jason doesnft let his hatred for Alex show. Theyfre at the inn together and Jason comes up with a plan to drug both Alex and Elysia so he can put them in bed together so Alex will have to marry her due to a presumed scandal. His plan worked but also backfired on him, as Alex and Elysia were fine with marrying each other. That part bugged me greatly. Neither of them were angry about what happened. The marriage happened too early on in the story, about a third of the way. They married and got along for awhile then Alex turned into a jealous, abusive ass. He once grabbed her by the arm and later shook her by both arms two different times and told her hefd hit her in the face if he wasnft a egentlemanf. It was said too many times that he had ehawk-like featuresf.<br /><br />The story got worse. Another crazy nut, Mrs. Blackmore, was out to kill Elysia and tried to twice. Shefs jealous because her teen daughter, Louisa, canft marry Alex because hefs now married to Elysia. While laying there injured in the woods, her edeadf bother Ian showed up after being presumed dead for two years. Adding him to the story was so unnecessary. All it did was add a bunch of BS to a story that wasnft good anyway. Adding Alexfs brother Peter to the story was a waste too.<br /><br />There were too many jealous, mentally unstable people in this book; Abusive aunt Agatha, Jason, Mrs. Blackstone, and Alexfs ex-mistress, Mariana Woodley.<br /><br />I was enjoying the story until Alex and Elysia were OK with getting married. The only parts l liked were those involving Jason. Ifd hoped he would be out to sabotage their marriage but it wasnft to be. He did his evil deed and was done away with. He could have gotten together with Alexfs ex-mistress and done some real damage.<br /><br />I absolutely hate the new cover. Elysiafs supposed to have red-gold hair, not auburn. On the original cover her hair color is right but itfs not curly like stated in the book.the story was so unnecessary. All it did was add a bunch of BS to a story that wasnft good anyway.

He has long urged that innocent people who were wrongly convicted of crimes should be compensated for their wrongs and injuries ('Preface‚Äô). Federal and state governments did not do so (in 1932). Some believed that it is a ‚Äúphysical impossibility‚Äù to convict an innocent man. So 65 cases were selected from a much larger number to refute this supposition. Most of these cases were taken from the twentieth century. Fifty of these cases are more important, fifteen are presented concisely. Innocence was established by: the appearance of the alleged murder victim, the conviction of the real culprit, or the discovery of new evidence. This does not include cases of pardon without an admission of erroneous conviction. These cases are mostly due to: mistaken identification, circumstantial evidence (where erroneous inferences are drawn), perjury, or a combination of these errors. There is no index to the people involved.<br /><br />Each of the fifty cases take up about six pages each, the fifteen supplementary cases each have about three pages. The ‚ÄòConclusion‚Äô summarizes the mistakes in these cases. The major source of these errors was the identification of the accused by the victim of a crime of violence. Besides the emotions of the victim, other factors enter (desire for revenge, support an identification made by others). In many of these cases there was a little resemblance between the wrongfully accused and the actually guilty criminal. Little scientific study has been done on the effects of suggestion or defective powers of observation. There are enough wrongful convictions on circumstantial evidence to be disturbing. Circumstantial evidence coming from different sources is less likely to be false. But evidence can be manufactured or suppressed (p.369). Presenting evidence of a prior conviction can prejudice a jury against a defendant (p.370). The use of thethird degree‚Äù to produce confessions is a public disgrace (p.371). Such ‚Äúconfessions‚Äù are a factor in wrongful convictions. Public opinion can be blamed when passions are aroused and demand a sacrificial victim. How many wrongfully convicted have been executed is impossible to say (p.373). There are problems in the unreliability of ‚Äúexpert‚Äù evidence. An alibi or collateral testimony which is false will be extremely prejudicial to the defendant, even if innocent. A defendant who is poor and can‚Äôt hire a competent attorney will be convicted (p.374). Borchard recommends an independent investigating committee to consider certain cases (p.375). An appeals court should review cases on the facts as well as on the law in felony or at least capital cases. A review on the facts could set aside an unjust verdict, and correct errors in the administration of justice (p.376). Borchard recommends the NY law that allows an appeal court to order a new trial if the verdict was against the weight of evidence or against law, even if no exception was taken in court.<br /><br />Borchard thinks highly of English law (pp.377 378) and its laws on paper. But that didn‚Äôt save an innocent from the gallows (‚Äú10 Rillington Place‚Äù) and the abolishment of capital punishment around 1962. Borchard urges the adoption of legislation to indemnify the wrongfully convicted. Any amounts should be adjusted for the devalued currency (or ‚Äúinflation‚Äù).	2005-09-29

The text is quite lyrical with catchy-rhymes on every page and children love looking at the illustrations of the cuddly-looking creatures. The book's ending always seemed to capture several \\"Ah's\\" from the kids at the day care where I worked. Recommended for children around seven years and younger.	2002-05-09
